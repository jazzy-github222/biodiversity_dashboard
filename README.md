## Introduction üë©‚Äçüíª
Welcome to my repo! My name is Jazzy the Creator of this code. while you're here take a look around at some of my other amazing projects too! 


## Background üåÖ
I've created an interactive dashboard to explore a Belly Button Biodiversity dataset. We'll venture into the microscopic world of belly button microbes and discover which ones are the real MVPs, while also uncovering some super rare finds. Get ready for a journey filled with curiosity, exploration, and learning something new!

## Analysis üîç
To see the dashboard simply drag and drop the html file into your browser webpage, you can interact with the dataset and learn from over 50 different samples.
